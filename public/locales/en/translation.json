I graduated as an engineer in Information and Communication Technologies and Embedded Systems (TICSE) in September '2018'      \n \n          I began my career working on the 'RECRUTE_SOURCING' project at Norsys Afrique, where I contributed to the analysis, development, and bug fixing of a cross-platform recruitment and sourcing management application.    \n \n        Later, in March '2020', I joined M2MGROUP as a study and development engineer. I worked on projects such as BMCE and MAUBANK, where I developed customized solutions and wrote technical documents.    \n \n        In February '2021', I joined Techtrend Solutions as a software engineer. I contributed to the development of new features and bug fixing for the '07ZR' client project.    \n \n        Since August '2021', I have been working at Payment Center for Africa as a software engineer. I have participated in various projects, including CHAABI PAY, BPAY, and SWIPE, providing IT solutions, developing new features, and ensuring solution maintenance.    \n \n        In addition, I have been mentoring students in PHP/Symfony application development projects at OpenClassrooms since January '2021'.    \n \n        I have acquired a diverse set of skills, including working with tools such as React JS/Native, Git, SQL, Keycloak, REST API, Java, Scrum, as well as having a strong knowledge of Symfony, PHP, MySQL, and other technologies.    \n \n        I am passionate about software development and have demonstrated my ability to adapt to different projects and work effectively in a team.    \n \n        ",

PHP remains my preferred language, and Symfony is the framework I adore. \n \n\n \n I make an effort to stay up-to-date with the latest Symfony developments. However, in the past couple of years, I discovered React, and that's where my passion for frontend development ignited. Every day, I strive to improve myself and learn new things in this field. \n \nMy passion for development has given me two things: the joy of learning and the pleasure of sharing knowledge. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n To unwind, I find hiking to be a rejuvenating activity. There's a sense of challenge and productivity when I ascend mountains, making me appreciate life even more. Moreover, I have had the opportunity to explore precious places through image galleries. These experiences have left a profound impact on me and have helped me develop a deeper appreciation for the beauty of our world."
